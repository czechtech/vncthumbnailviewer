This is verion 1.1 of the ThumbnailViewer.  It is based on/uses tightvnc's java viewer v.1.3.9


You can execute the VncThumbnailViewer by running:
     java -classpath VncThumbnailViewer.jar VncThumbnailViewer

You can specify servers to connect to on the commandline:
     java -classpath VncThumbnailViewer.jar VncThumbnailViewer HOST 192.168.0.106 PORT 5900 PASSWORD pa$s HOST 192.168.0.107 PORT 5900 PASSWORD p@ss

You can use "hostname" instead of "host" on the commandline to specify a hostname instead of an IP address.
     java -classpath VncThumbnailViewer.jar VncThumbnailViewer HOSTNAME labpc-01.school.edu PORT 5900 PASSWORD pa$s

You can use "encpassword" instead of "password" on the commandline to specify a vnc encrypted password instead of plaintext.
     java -classpath VncThumbnailViewer.jar VncThumbnailViewer HOST 192.168.0.106 PORT 5900 ENCPASSWORD 40CCA9718FFB8E91

I suggest increasing the Java Heap Size when running this.  You can do this by adding the following commandline option:
     -Xmx128m
