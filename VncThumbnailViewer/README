This is verion 1.0 of the ThumbnailViewer.  It is based on/uses tightvnc's java viewer v.1.3.9


You can execute the ThumbnailViewer by running:
     java -classpath ThumbnailViewer.jar ThumbnailViewer


I suggest increasing the Java Heap Size when running this.  You can do this by adding the following commandline option:
     -Xmx128m
